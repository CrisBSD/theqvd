=head1 NAME

QVD::CommandInterpreter::Client - Client for QVD command interpreter

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Talks to qvdcmd over a TCP socket. Currently offers serial port forwarding,
other functionality is expected in the future.

This module is used by the commandline B<qvdconnect> application.

=head1 EXAMPLE

 $ ./qvdconnect --interpreter localhost:2000 --getversion
 0.01

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS


=head2 new HOST, PORT

Connects to a QVD::CommandInterpreter running on the indicated HOST and PORT,
waits for the command prompt to be received, and returns.

=cut

sub new {
	my ($class, %opts) = @_;
	my $self = {};

	$self->{log}  = Log::Log4perl->get_logger('QVD::CommandInterpreter::Client');
	$self->{host} = $opts{host} // 'localhost:2000';
	bless $self, $class;

	$self->_connect();
	return $self;
}

sub _connect {
	my ($self) = @_;

	my $addr = $self->{host};

	$self->{log}->debug("Connecting to QVD::CommandInterpreter on $addr");

	$self->{sock} = new IO::Socket::INET(PeerAddr => $addr );
	if ( !$self->{sock} ) {
		die "Failed to connect to $addr";
	}
	$self->{log}->debug("Connected");
	$self->{sock}->autoflush(1);
	$self->_wait_prompt();
}

=head2 version

Returns the version of the remote QVD::CommandInterpreter

=cut

sub version {
	my ($self) = @_;
	return $self->_send_cmd('version');
}

=head2 help

Returns the results of the "help" command.

The result describes the protocol level commands, which
is of little use in practical usage.

=cut

sub help {
	my ($self) = @_;
	return $self->_send_cmd('help');
}

=head2 socat PORT

Asks the remote QVD::CommandInterpreter to connect socat to the indicated
port.

Returns an IO::Socket connected to socat on the other side.

=cut


sub socat {
	my ($self, $port) = @_;
	my $sock = $self->{sock};

	$self->{log}->debug("Sending command: socat $port");
	print $sock "socat $port\n";

	$self->{log}->debug("Waiting for answer");
	my $answer = <$sock>;

	$self->{log}->debug("Answer is: $answer");
	if ( $answer =~ /^OK/ ) {
		$self->{log}->debug("Remote socat successful");
		return $self->{sock};
	} else {
		$self->{log}->error("Remote socat error: $answer");
		die "Server refused to connect port: $answer";
	}
}


=head2 quit

Disconnects from the remote QVD::CommandInterpreter.

Returns the parting message, normally "Bye."

=cut

sub quit {
	my ($self, $port) = @_;
	return $self->_send_cmd('quit');
}

sub _send_cmd {
	my ($self, @cmd) = @_;
	my $sock = $self->{sock};
	my $cmdstr = join(' ', @cmd); 

	$self->{log}->debug("Sending command: $cmdstr");

	print $sock "$cmdstr\n";
	return $self->_wait_prompt();
}

sub _wait_prompt {
	my ($self) = @_;


	my $sock = $self->{sock};
	my $status; # read() status

	my $buf;              # accumulated output
	my $whole_lines = ""; # entirely received lines
	my $data;             # received block of data

	$self->{log}->debug("Waiting for prompt");
	while(defined ($status = $sock->recv($data, 512))) {
		#print STDERR "READ: '$data'\n";

		$buf .= $data;

		# If we have a \n, then everything before it makes a complete line,
		# which goes into $whole_lines. That is the output of the commands we run
		while ( $buf =~ /(.*?)\n/ ) {
			$whole_lines .= "$1\n";
			$buf =~ s/^.*?\n//;
		}

		if ( $buf =~ /^> / ) {
			# First one to remove the blank line in the protocol, second to remove
			# the \n after the last line of output

			chomp $whole_lines;
			chomp $whole_lines;
			$self->{log}->debug("Prompt found");
			return $whole_lines;
		}

	}

	chomp $whole_lines;
	chomp $whole_lines;
	$self->{log}->debug("Socket was closed");
	return $whole_lines;
}
