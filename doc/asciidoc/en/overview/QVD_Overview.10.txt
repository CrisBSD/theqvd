QVD OVERVIEW
============
v1.1, February 2011

Introduction
------------

QVD (Quality Virtual Desktop) is a *Linux* focused VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure). What does it means?, means that the desktops delivered to the clients are Linux desktops. These desktops are virtualized by KVM (Linux kernel virtual machine), and intend to be a fully integrated solution, what involves that all the components are fully integrated.

Desktop Virtualization is at its early ages and the necessity for companies to keep their data under control are growing including those in the user desktops. QVD is a product that relies on user desktops. 

QVD Fundamentals
----------------

QVD is written in Perl and it runs on Linux OS. As the delivery protocol is Nx, the user desktop runs as a remote X11 session even across slow or low-bandwidth connections. It's possible to run the client on Windows and Linux platforms or via Thin Clients. 

Basics
~~~~~~

QVD is composed by several actors and components. 

QVD actors are:

	* Users (End Users)
	* Virtual Machines
	* Nodes
	* Images

Users: People that work at their desks, using office packages, email, whatever. Must be identified by login and password. 
Virtual Machines: Running Linux Desktops and owned by the users. These VMs run under KVM on Linux Nodes.
Nodes: Physical servers where the VMs run. 
Images: Templates with shared properties as applications installed, memory for the VM or space for the user's home.  

QVD components are:

	* QVD-Client. 
	* QVD-L7R (Level 7 Router)
	* QVD-HKD (House Keeping Daemon)
	* QVD-Node
	* QVD-Database
	* QVD-Administration tools
	* QVD-VMA (Virtual Machine Agent)

*QVD-Client*: A piece of software that's connects the user with the virtual Machine. Able to push some user's devices front the user physical workstation through his virtual machines. +
*QVD-L7R*: In charge to balance the connections from the QVD-Client to the Virtual Machines and the responsibility for login user before they went into their Virtual Machines. +
*QVD-HKD*: Responsible to interact with the Virtual Machines, starting, stopping, and update the VMs status in the QVD Database. +
*QVD-Node*: Daemon running at in the nodes, in charge to manage the QVD-L7R and the QVD-HKD. +
*QVD-Database*: Holds the status for all users, Vitual Machines, images, hosts. All the platform information is held by the database. +
*QVD-Administrative tools*: Composed by CLI and the WAT (Web administration tool) that provides an easy and simple way to administrate the whole platform, from a couple of nodes to hundreds. +
*QVD-VMA*: The agent that runs in the Virtual Machine, allowing users to connect, enable printer sharing, audio, hooks, etc. +


Network Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QVD is a 3-tier solution from a Network perspective, the QVD-Client connects to the QVD-L7R and this connection is forwarded directly to the virtual machine. Each virtual machine has is own IP Address. Each Node has an firewall running that provides security to the Virtual Machines at bridge level. All the virtual machines must be in the same subnet, at this moment a different farm must be created if two or more networks are required. A DHCP server runs in each host to provide the correct IP to each virtual Machine.

The NICs for each VM are tap interfaces. Those will be bridged to a specific physical NIC of the node. So the VMs will be at the same network that the nodes. 

The bridge *MUST* exist before HKD is running and it *MUST* be created manually, by default the bridge's name will be qvdnet0. 

Tap interfaces will be created by HKD and for the KVM perspective they will be passed as file descriptor 3. 


IP Addresses for VMs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IP address for each VM is fixed at the VM creation and cannot be modified after that. The assignation is implemented at the QVD/Admin.pm. 
Each VM asks for his IP via DHCP, each node runs a DHCP server managed by the HKD that just assigns static IP address. 
The DHCP server is configured to assign IP to *ALL* the VMs in the cluster, included those that run in another node or they are not in execution. 

MAC Address for VMs.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HKD calculates the MAC address for each VM from the IP address that each VM has assigned, thus the IP address is A.B.C.D is related to MAC 54:52:00:B:C:D (with its corresponding hexadecimal conversion). 


Firewall
^^^^^^^^

QVD uses two complementing firewalls, iptables and ebtables, the reason is have a firewall at bridge level ebtables and iptables at node level. 

At Node Level these are the rules that QVD applies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ebtables INPUT -i $tap -j QVD_INPUT_$tap
 * ebtables FORWARD -i $tap -j QVD_FORWARD_$tap
 * ebtables QVD_FORWARD_$tap -s ! $mac -j DROP
 * ebtables QVD_INPUT_$tap -s ! $mac -j DROP
 * ebtables QVD_FORWARD_$tap -p 0x800 --ip-source ! $ip -j DROP
 * ebtables QVD_INPUT_$tap -p 0x800 --ip-protocol 17 --ip-source 0.0.0.0 --ip-destination-port = 67 -j ACCEPT
 * ebtables QVD_INPUT_$tap -p 0x800 --ip-source ! $ip -j DROP 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Alternative Configuration 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is another way that QVD allows, This is to use the QVD-L7R as standalone frontend. In large nodes farms, could be convenient use the L7R as frontend between the loadbalancer and the nodes. The L7R accepts the connection and forward it to another its corresponding L7R in the node where the Virtual Machine is running. 

[NOTE] 
A loadbalancer is still needed to get a unique IP address where all the clients connect. 

The following diagram represents this configuration

Storage Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overlays and OSIS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

And overlay is an hard disk image that stores the disk changes in an external file, instead to the proper disk image. As we are talking about environments with hundreds or thousands of users, is a good idea create a template that stores the information that sets of users have in common and the changes in the operating systems, (logs principally), were stored in the overlay, saving lots of disk space. 
Therefore in QVD, every VM is composed by at least two parts, an OSI, that is common for all the users with similar characteristics and an overlay, that contains all the information that the virtual machine modifies itself. 

[NOTE]

OSIS have just read only access.

[NOTE]

Overlays can be persistent or not, by default they are not. 

[TIP]
The user information should not be stored in the overlay, if not external storage is disposed to store the user's data an additional disk can be enabled at the OSI creation time, to allow users keep their data in its home directory.
