GUI Client User Guide
=====================

The GUI Client lets you start a session of your virtual machine in a remote server.

Usage
-----

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux
^^^^^

On Linux systems, to install on Ubuntu distros it is necessary to add QVD's repository. To do so edit as root your '/etc/apt/sources.list' and add the following:

....
deb http://qvd.qindel.com/debian lucid main
....

Once this step is done you need to update the apt cache: 

....

sudo apt-get update

....

And install the qvd-client:

....

apt-get install qvd-client

....


Windows
^^^^^^^

For Windows XP just run the setup program and follow the screen instructions. 

Running the client
-----------------

Linux
~~~~~

Ubuntu
^^^^^^

Run the client:

----
/usr/bin/qvd-gui-client.pl
----

You should get a screen like this:

Populate the "User", "Password" and "Server" fields, click "Connect" and you are done. After a while you get a window with your remote desktop inside.

Also you'll find an access via Menu--> Applications--> Internet--> QVD Client.

Windows XP
^^^^^^^^^^

On XP systems you'll find an access under Start->Program Files->QVD->QVD Client. Click it and follow the same instructions that under Linux systems. 

Troubleshooting
---------------

Unable to connect to host:port at QVD-Client/lib/QVD/Client/Frame.pmâ€¦
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message appears when the server is not responding to the client petition:

    * Ensure all components are running in the server side, HKD, L7R and RC.
    * Check server logs, by default in "/var/log/qvd.log".
    * Check exists network communication client <-> server. Do crossed pings. 

The server has rejected your login. Please verify that your username and password are correct.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This messages occurs when exists communication between client and server but the user can't be authenticated:

    * Verify username and password.
    * Verify user exists in QVD user list:
----
      QVD-Admin/bin/qvd-admin.pl user list
----
    * If you are using LDAP authentication verify user and password in your LDAP server.
