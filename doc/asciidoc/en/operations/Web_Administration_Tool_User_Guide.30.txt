Web Administration Tool User Guide
----------------------------------
Login
~~~~~

That's your very first step, to log in use the default user (login:admin password:admin) or the one you define in https://intranet.qindel.com/trac/QVD/wiki/HowToInstall#RunWAT

Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~

Gives you an overview of the QVD state:

    * Virtual machines running, failed or stopped.
    * Sessions in course and potential (equals the number of virtual machines).
    * And the totals of users, virtual machines, nodes (physical machines that host the virtual) and images (templates for virtual machines).

Virtual machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connecting via VNC to a machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Click the magnifying glass icon on the row of the virtual machine.
    * Click "VNC local client". 

Nodes
~~~~~

Here you can define new nodes and check the actual ones. To remove a node you must use the Command Line Interface?. 

To create a node just add a name and the ip address.
