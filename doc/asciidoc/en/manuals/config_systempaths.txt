The following options are available to change the paths that QVD uses to search for applications, certificates and other QVD
specific data.

----
path.run = /var/run/qvd
path.log = /var/log
path.tmp = /var/tmp
path.storage.root = /var/lib/qvd/storage
path.storage.staging = ${path.storage.root}/staging
path.storage.images = ${path.storage.root}/images
path.storage.overlays = ${path.storage.root}/overlays
path.storage.homes = ${path.storage.root}/homes
path.ssl.certs = ${path.run}/ssl
path.ssl.ca.system = /etc/ssl/certs
path.ssl.ca.personal = .qvd/certs
path.serial.captures = ${path.tmp}/qvd

command.kvm = kvm
command.kvm-img = kvm-img
command.nxagent = /usr/bin/nxagent
command.nxdiag = /usr/bin/nxdiag.pl
command.x-session = /etc/X11/Xsession

command.useradd = /usr/sbin/useradd
command.userdel = /usr/sbin/userdel
