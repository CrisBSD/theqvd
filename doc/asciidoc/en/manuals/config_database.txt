The node.conf file should at least contain the following:

----
#Â·
# QVD Node Configuration
#

# Database connection information.
# database.host: where the QVD database is found
# database.name: the name of the QVD database
# database.user: the user account needed to connect
# database.password: the password needed to connect
database.host = mycomputer
database.name = QVDDatabase
database.user = QVDUser
database.password = passw0rd
----

You should ensure that the *database.host*, *database.name*,
*database.user* and *database.password* contain values that match the
environment that you have set up.

Once these settings are in place any utility that requires access to
the database will have the appropriate configuration details to do so.
