QVD Audio 
---------

This section explains how audio played on the virtual desktop is rerouted and
replayed on the client machine.

Technical Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QVD uses the *PulseAudio* sound server, the default audio system on most
mainstream Linux distributions, to route audio between the client machine
and the virtual machine. PulseAudio is network-transparent in the same was as
X11: sound played on a remote audio client is easy to redirect to a local
server.

The QVD client includes a PulseAudio server for platforms that don't use it
natively.

Enabling audio on the client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable audio redirection on the QVD client, add the following lines to
`client.conf`.

----
# Enable audio redirection
client.audio.enable = 1
----

For more details see the client configuration guide.

Addtional setup needed for Linux clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux users need to enable unauthenticated network access to the system
pulseaudio server. The easiest way to do this is with the `paprefs`
application.

Enabling audio on the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable audio redirection on the QVD server, add the following lines to
`/etc/qvd/vma.conf` on the virtual machine image.

----
# Enable audio redirection
vma.audio.enable = 1
