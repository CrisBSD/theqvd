What is QVD?
-------------

QVD (Quality Virtual Desktop) is a Linux focused VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure). The software is designed to entirely virtualize the Linux desktop, so that client systems are able to connect to a central server to load their desktop environment and applications. This means that when users work from their local machine, all of the programs, applications, processes, and data used are kept on the server and run centrally. Virtualization offers a number of benefits:

* Users can switch between computers on a network and continue to work as if still located at the same desktop, with full access to all of their applications and data
* Administrators have greater control over the applications that are installed on user’s systems, and are able to manage user data more easily to perform backups and virus scans etc
* It is easier for Administrators to provision new desktops and to deploy applications for new users
* There is reduced downtime in the case of hardware failures
* Users can make use of a variety of different devices to access their desktop and applications, including laptops, PCs and smartphones
* Users can work securely with the same desktop and applications from a remote location without the requirement for a VPN
* Improved overall system and data security
* Reduced costs of hardware, maintenance and administration

The QVD Server virtualizes each Linux Desktop. This can be achieved by using one of two virtualization technologies. Most commonly the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) is used as a complete bare-metal hypervisor, however as of QVD 3.1, it is also possibly to take advantage of Linux Containers (LXC) to achieve operating-system level virtualization. This virtualization helps to keep each user's environment as its own discrete entity, to improve security and stability. Virtualization allows you to serve multiple Operating Systems or environments to your users, depending on their requirements. These are loaded as independent Images on the QVD Server. In general, you will only load one or two images for all of your users. These images provide the base operating system and workstation environment, which are replicated for each virtual machine. When a user connects to the server, making use of the client application, a Virtual Machine is started solely for that user. This provides a jail that prevents any inappropriate system behaviour from affecting other users. When the user disconnects, the Virtual Machine is stopped. This means that if the user’s environment has somehow become problematic, a disconnect can revert the environment to its original state. This provides a much better level of security than if a user was working on an independent workstation.

In order to maintain user data, such as desktop settings, documents and other user specific information, there are two options. The first, and more common approach, is to store this information on an NFS share. In this way, data can be stored on a NAS device or within a SAN, where it can be easily managed. A second option is to load a second image into the virtual machine. This image is persistent, in that it can be updated by the user, and the changes are stored for each time the image is reloaded. Either approach is equally valid. By keeping user data separate from the core image, QVD helps to ensure that in the event that a core image is corrupted or in the event of system failure, you are able to minimize the time needed for disaster recovery.

The desktop is accessed from each workstation, making use of a client that uses the NX protocol to communicate with the server and to deliver the desktop and applications to the client. The NX protocol is used to handle remote X Windows connections and provides superior compression to allow for high performance even when accessing the desktop over a low-bandwidth connection. Furthermore, the NX protocol makes use of SSL to secure connectivity so that users can work in a safe and secure manner, even if accessing their desktops from remote locations. QVD provides client software to run on a variety of base operating systems and devices, from Linux to Windows. This means that wherever you are, regardless of the system that you have access to, you can run the client application to access your Desktop.
