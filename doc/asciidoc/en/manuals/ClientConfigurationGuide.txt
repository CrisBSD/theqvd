QVD Client Configuration Guide
==============================

This section explains the QVD client configuration options.

At the moment the client can only be configured through the configuration file.

Where to find the configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration file is called `client.conf`. Its exact path depends on the
client operating system:

* *Linux* - see `$HOME/.qvd/client.conf`
* *Windows* - see `%APPDATA%/.qvd/client.conf` 

TIP: %APPDATA% depends on the Windows version and language. To find out where
it's located open cmd.exe and type `echo %APPDATA%`.

Configuration options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following options can be used to enable client features:

* *client.user.name* - The user name used to connect
* *client.host.name* - The QVD server to connect to
* *client.link* - The connection quality, one of `local`,`adsl`, or `modem`
* *client.audio.enable* - Enable audio redirection. Either 0 or 1.
* *client.printing.enable* - Enable printer redirection. Either 0 or 1.
* *client.geometry* - Session window size as WIDTHxHEIGHT.
* *client.fullscreen* - Open session in full screen. Either 0 or 1.

The following options can be used to enforce settings, useful for
enterprise installations.

* *client.force.host.name* - The QVD server to connect to. When used the
  hostname field is not displayed.
* *client.force.link* - The connection quality, one of `local`, `adsl`, or
  `modem`. When used the link field is not displayed.


The following is an example of a complete client configuration file.

# Lines that start with # are ignored
