If youâ€™ve found something wrong with the product, or you want to
request a new feature, let us know! We ask community members to
link:http://theqvd.com/trac/register[register with our Trac], and post 
tickets here. Once you are logged in, you can post a new ticket here:

link:http://theqvd.com/trac/newticket[Post a bug report or request a
feature enhancement]

The public Trac facility is kept separate from the internal Trac, so
that community members can help each other out and so that we can
properly manage the priority of our tickets. Once a public ticket has
been recognized by our core development team, it is copied into the
internal Trac and we start working on it. We notify you of the change
of status via the public Trac and keep you up to date with the
progress of the ticket.
