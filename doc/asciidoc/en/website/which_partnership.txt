The QVD Team recognizes that partners may have different operating
parameters and different resources available. For this reason, we have
designed two different partnership deals. These are outlined below.

Partnership Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The QVD offers two different partnership agreements with prospective
resellers and systems integrators.

1. *Commercial Resellers (CRs)*: have a minimal responsibility to an
   end-client but are able to take advantage of discounted licensing
   and official QVD sales training. Through this agreement, your only
   responsibility will be to sell licenses but you will be able to
   take advantage of the official support and professional services
   that can be provided by the QVD team.
2. *Commercial Integrators and Resellers (CRIs)*: take on more
   responsibility for an end-client, including providing installation
   support and professional services engagement, along with first-tier
   support after a deployment goes live. Under this agreement, you
   will get better licensing discounts and will also get discounted
   support and training from the QVD team. Naturally, this agreement
   provides better returns, but also adds to your responsibility with
   regard to your customers.

During the process of becoming a certified QVD Partner, you will need
to decide which agreement you would like to be certified under. You
will also need to complete the required training in order to become a
recognized partner, so that we can ensure that the service you offer
your customers is of the highest quality possible.

Note that once you have submitted a partnership request, you will be provided
with details on the different benefits that are available under our different
partnership agreements. The chart above provides a simple guideline for the most
obvious requirements and responsibilities that you will have to meet in order
to qualify for partnership. More details are provided in the Partner Pack that
will be shared with you once you have submitted your application.
