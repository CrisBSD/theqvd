QVD provides a wide range of features that you would expect from any
commercial VDI.

High Density VDI Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QVD is a container virtualization platform that is able to run
multiple virtual machines from one or more operating system images on
a single network node. In fact, QVD can use either light weight container 
virtualization or can offer full scale virtualization, depending on
your requirements. By re-using a base operating system image
loaded into multiple virtual machines, you can standardize the
environment that you provide to your work force, easing management and
reducing costs significantly. QVD is designed to run multiple desktops
per server node to service many users.

Load balancing and High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In an enterprise environment where QVD is expected to support hundreds
of users, it is unfeasible to run each desktop on the same server
node. QVD is designed to work with clusters of server nodes, each
running the virtual machines to service different sets of users. QVD
makes use of its own built-in Layer-7 Routing daemon to broker
connections and to ensure that a client that connects to any one
server node is directed to the correct node in order to access the
appropriate desktop. If a virtual machine for a particular user is not
running on an available server node, QVD intelligently determines
which server node has the most resources available to start the
virtual machine. This helps to ensure High-Availability of all desktop
environments, even in the case that a server node fails.

Auto Provisioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By simply setting a username and password within the QVD environment,
and assigning the user with a chosen desktop image, it is possible to
provision a desktop within seconds. QVD also integrates with external
authentication systems and supports authentication using LDAP. This
means that as soon as you have added a user into the QVD platform, you
can either make use of the internal authentication mechanism, or
integrate with an external provider such as Active Directory.
Furthermore, the command-line tools and scriptability built into the
product, makes it very easy to batch script an auto-provisioning
script so that when a user is added to your environment, a desktop is
automatically generated.

Client Platform Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QVD currently provides client software for Linux and Windows
environments. There is also an Android client in development. QVD is
designed to be accessible to users from any base operating system.
Allowing users the flexibility to access their desktops from any
system that they have on hand. By simply running the client, the user
can gain access to a desktop within seconds. Due to the client-server
model behind QVD, it is possible to see the potential for instant
disaster recovery. So that if a user’s desktop system suffers severe
hardware failure, any other system can be put in place so that the
user has access to all of his or her data and applications instantly.

Web-based Administration Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While QVD provides command-line based administration tools to allow
flexibility through scripting batch operations, and to allow
administrators to work over SSH and other remote access facilities;
QVD also provides a fully featured Web-based Administration
Environment providing a complete GUI to manage and monitor the entire
infrastructure.

The QVD Web Administration Tool makes managing and monitoring your QVD
infrastructure simple. This Web-based GUI provides a point-and-click
facility for your systems administrators to keep control over users,
virtual machines and operating system images. The Web Administration
Tool even comes with a java applet that directly connects to the
serial port console of any running virtual machine, so that an
Administrator can quickly connect to a user’s environment and offer
support.

Check out our demonstration video of the QVD Web Administration
Tool, to see how easy it is to manage a QVD deployment:

Security
~~~~~~~~
QVD provides a high-level of security within the enterprise
environment. By running the operating system image in read-only mode
within a virtual machine, any system level compromise to a virtual
machine will only affect the desktop for as long as the virtual
machine is running. This means that if a desktop is compromised,
simply restarting the virtual machine is sufficient to reset it to its
original state. By jailing users within their own virtual machines,
user level behavior cannot affect other users, ensuring the smooth
running of all desktops. Finally, client connections are all encrypted
using standard SSL/TLS certificates so that all communications between
a workstation and the actual desktop environment are properly secured.

Remote Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QVD makes use of a modified version of the NX-protocol, which can
massively reduce bandwidth overhead when serving an X-Windows
environment over the Internet. QVD provides different compression
algorithms depending on the user’s selected bandwidth setting,
allowing users to connect from extremely low-bandwidth environments.
With the appropriate network configuration, users can access their
desktops remotely and securely whether based at home or on the road.
Instead of setting up a VPN and then serving files across the
Internet, a user making use of QVD will be able to access his or her
entire desktop as if working locally. That means having access to all
of his or her applications, internal network shares and personal data.
