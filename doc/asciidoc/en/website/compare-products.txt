QVD Server Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Both the Community and Commercial Editions include the QVD Server Components required to deploy a functioning VDI.
This includes the QVD Database, QVD Server Node Daemon, QVD House Keeping Daemon and QVD Layer-7 Routing Daemon. With
these base components, it is simple to create the base infrastructure required to get QVD up and running.

The QVD Cloud Edition is fully hosted, so you don't need to get your hands dirty installing or working with server-side
software. We take care of all of that for you.

Multi-platform QVD GUI Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Whichever edition you choose, you will need the QVD GUI Client in order for your users to access their desktops. Currently
QVD provides clients for both Windows and Linux operating systems, and we've got a client for Android in development right now.
Users of all editions can download the client software for free and install it on as many platforms as required.

If you're serious about creating a seamless experience for your users, you should consider using the QVD Commercial or Cloud 
Editions, and we will provide you with thin-client software that can be installed onto your workstations in order for your
users to directly login to their desktops without needing to switch from the host operating system.

QVD Web Administration Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The QVD Web Administration Tool makes managing and monitoring your QVD infrastructure simple. This Web-based GUI provides
a point-and-click facility for your systems administrators to keep control over users, virtual machines and operating system
images. The Web Administration Tool even comes with a java applet that directly connects to the serial port console of any
running virtual machine, so that an Administrator can quickly connect to a user's environment and offer support.

QVD Bug Submission and Feature Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order for QVD to progress we need to know about bugs in the software, that's why we make it possible for anybody to submit
a bug report. We also want to know about new features that our customers and users are interested in seeing within the product.
Whether you're using the Open-Source Edition, or you're a fully paying customer, we will listen to your requests. If you find
something in our product that needs improvement, head over to our Community pages and Report a Bug.

For paying customers, we have a complete SLA that will help to
guarantee that bug submissions and feature requests are dealt with
expediently and that you are kept constantly updated as to the status
of your ticket.

QVD Priority Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While we take all bug reports and feature requests seriously, we have to look after our paying customers first. After all, these
are the guys that make this software possible in the first place. Users of the Commercial Edition and Cloud Edition are able to
submit priority bug reports and feature requests. We also offer them a Next Business Day support guarantee, ensuring that they are
looked after 24/7.

QVD Priority Support includes access to our internal knowledge-base, and will give you access to all of the resources required to
make sure that your deployment runs smoothly and that you are able to integrate it with whatever infrastructure you are currently using.

QVD Thin-client Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
QVD Commercial and Cloud Editions have access to QVD's own Thin-client software. This base Linux operating system has been cut down and
purposefully designed so that when the system boots, the end-user is finally presented with a QVD login screen. This means that your end
users should never be accessing the underlying host software, and can have a seamless experience of their desktop environment as if 
working locally directly on the workstation. This helps to reduce workstation support requirements and ensures that your users actually
make direct use of their virtual desktop and don't take advantage of the underlying host operating system to perform other activities.

QVD Professional Services Discount
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We know that designing and deploying a VDI can be intimidating, especially when you are trying to get things working for hundreds of users
while integrating with existing infrastructure. Commercial Edition customers have discounted access to all of the QVD expertise directly from our team.
We can help you design and deploy your VDI so that it runs properly and so that it fits well with the rest of your existing infrastructure.
You can rest assured that your QVD deployment functions in a fully-supportable manner and that you have the best possible team helping you go-live.

Check out our link:/support/professional-services[Professional Services] page to fully explore the advantages of being a Commercial Edition customer.

Pre-configured Base System Disk Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While we provide demonstration operating system disk images to users of our Community Edition, these are very slimmed down and provide minimal 
functionality. For paying customers, we can help you tailor your Disk Images to your required environment. This includes adapting
any Linux distribution to suit your own needs. By taking advantage of our commercial support package, you can be sure that the Disk
Image that is being loaded into your virtual machines, is wholly compatible with the environment and that your users have access to
the software that they require.

Remote Support Management Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The QVD support team can work directly on your QVD deployment via VPN or over provisioned SSH access, so that in the case of a support call,
an engineer can access your infrastructure and make any required changes to fix any issues. That means that you can run your solution in
the full knowledge that if something goes wrong, there will always be somebody available to fix it instantly.

Fully Hosted and Managed QVD Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're making use of the QVD Cloud Edition, you don't have to worry about hardware or systems administration. You can leave all of that in
our hands. The QVD team will install the operating system images that you want to make use of and can help you provision your initial users.
Once you're up and running we will ensure that the VDI is kept up to date with all security patches and software updates that we release. You can
sit back and let your users connect to their desktops across the Internet. And that's all there is to it.
