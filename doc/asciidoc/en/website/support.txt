QVD Support is largely geared toward our licenced customers. While we
are more than happy to attend to bug submissions and wishlist requests
from our Community users, QVD Commercial Edition and QVD Cloud Edition
customers can expect high-quality commercial grade support provided
directly by the QVD Team and backed by Qindel.

Telephone Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently we provide a 24*7 telephone support line facilitated by
Qindel Group, based in Madrid in Spain. License-holders may call this
number at any time to open a support ticket:

IMPORTANT: [,,2]#+34 63 7825 553#

If you call this number, please have your license number available
before you call. Please note that the support consultant who takes
your call will log your ticket within the QVD Support database, but
may not be able to solve your issue directly. You will be contacted
shortly afterward by a qualified technical support consultant.

Email Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can also email our support desk directly by emailing:

IMPORTANT: [,,2]#link:mailto://support@theqvd.com[support@theqvd.com]#

In order for us to properly process your email, your license number
should appear at the beginning of the Subject line of your email.
Please provide a brief summary of the problem, and contact details in
order for our technical support engineers to be able to contact you.

Web Support
~~~~~~~~~~~
All of our support tickets are entered into our Request Tracker
software and tickets are monitored and managed by QVD Support
Engineers. If you want to submit a ticket directly into the system
yourself, you can visit our online customer portal at:

IMPORTANT:[,,2]#link:https://support.theqvd.com/[https://support.theqvd.com/]#

You will need to login with the username and password that you were
allocated when you purchased your licenses. 

Support Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QVD is committed to resolving customer problems efficiently. Regardless of the mechanism that you use to report
a ticket, the following basic procedure is followed:

* You ticket is created within our support system and is accessible to all Technical Support representatives.
* The Technical Support team evaluates your ticket and checks its severity level in order to assign case priority.
* A Technical Support representative will contact you to provide initial troubleshooting support and to log technical details that may assist an engineer in resolving the issue.
* The ticket is escalated to the engineering department, and the ticket is assigned to a dedicated engineer. The engineer will contact you directly to provide an estimated time to resolution and to begin work on the ticket.

Support Ticket Categorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QVD Support tickets are categorized according to their severity. This
will help to determine response time and allow the QVD team to prioritize
workload efficiently. When submitting a ticket, you should indicate
the severity level which you think best applies to your case. Note,
that if you indicate an inappropriate severity level, this will be
re-prioritized by our engineers and may delay the process.

The following severity levels have been defined:

[cols="1,4",frame="topbot",options="header",width="60%"]
|========================================================
|Severity Level |Description
|P1             |*Critical Error*

                 Errors in the QVD code that are causing a complete
                 failure of performance within the overall solution,
                 or a failure that is likely to result in data loss. 
                 Tickets posted with this severity level assume that
                 the situation does not allow the conduct of normal
                 business operations and there is no existing procedure 
                 to solve the problem.
                 
                 In order for the support team to be able to
                 troubleshoot and resolve issues at this severity
                 level, you will need dedicated resources available to
                 work with the support team to resolve the problem
                 during your office hours.
|P2             |*Serious Error*
                 
                 The software is functional, but its behaviour is
                 seriously impacting normal business operations.
                 Usually in these cases, a workaround can be
                 implemented in order to continue servicing desktops,
                 but an official fix is required.
|P3             |*Minor Functionality Error*
                 
                 A problem within the software that does not seriously
                 affect business operations, but that relates to the
                 non-proper functioning of a particular component or
                 behavior. Usually tickets in this category have a
                 functioning workaround and do not affect end-users
                 from making use of the service. Tickets for systems
                 that are in use within a production environment are
                 given higher priority.
|P4             |*General Usability Error*
                 
                 Tickets in this category relate to issues with the
                 general usability of the software, or reports of
                 documentation errors. Usually there is very low
                 or no impact on business operations as a result of
                 the issue.
|P5             |*Customization and Ad Hoc Requests*
                
                 Ad-hoc requests, regarding the performance or
                 customization of the product for a particular customer.
