Software
~~~~~~~~

1. *Can I install QVD on a single computer?*
Yes, although this is not the recommended approach. Our demo package
is designed to install all of the components on a single system so
that you can see how QVD actually behaves, however running a VDI to
service a number of users is usually pretty resource intensive so the
general approach is to run each logical component on a different
hardware device. This gives you the ability to scale your solution to service any
number of users and provides failover and load-balancing capability to
provide superior performance and high-availability.

2. *Do I have to use Ubuntu Linux to run QVD?*
No. All of the components make use of open-source software capable of
running on any Linux platform. Currently, we have packages available
for Ubuntu Linux and for SuSE. If you want to run QVD on another
distribution, you can either try to port it yourself, or get our
Professional Services team to help you. Whichever route you choose, we
will make sure that the packages get maintained and are always
available for other users.

3. *How can QVD lower costs for me?*
QVD can help you to reduce costs in a number of ways. Firstly, if you
are already considering using an alternate VDI on the market, you will
find that QVD will cost you less than anything that you will pay any
other vendor. If you're willing to run it without support, its
essentially free. However, any VDI will help to lower costs in many
other ways. By running a VDI, you can generally use much lower cost
hardware for user desktop systems as all of the processing, storage
and memory is handled directly by the VDI. Furthermore, if you choose
to make use of a Linux environment to service your users, you can
avoid paying many unnecessary license fees.

4. *Can QVD serve my Microsoft Windows users?*
No. QVD makes use of the NX protocol within the disk images that it
uses in order to serve Virtual Desktops. Currently there is no openly
available support for the NX protocol under Windows, so QVD is unable
to service Windows users. However, you should consider whether it is
entirely necessary that your users run on a Windows platform at all.
Many Windows applications have open-source alternatives that can run
under Linux and integrate with existing systems. It is also true that
as more businesses make use of cloud technology, the underlying
operating system is becoming less significant in terms of its actual
use within a business environment. If you choose Linux as your base
operating system, you will have access to the majority of mainstream
web-browsers, as well as applications such as LibreOffice/OpenOffice
and a variety of mail clients and database suites to service most
user's needs.

5. *Can QVD really scale to cater to the requirements of a truly large
organization?*
QVD has been deployed on an enterprise scale servicing over 35,000
users and handling up to 9,000 concurrent sessions at any one time in
a single deployment. QVD is currently used by BBVA Bancomer and is
considered a safe and secure environment to provision all of the bank
workstations across the organization.

Licenses
~~~~~~~~

1. *Do I need to have a license in order to run QVD?*
Certainly not. QVD is an open-source product and we believe that by
providing our software for free to an interested community, that we
will stand to benefit through community contributions. As a result, we
specially package each release to install on Ubuntu Linux and make it
available as the QVD Community Edition. If you don't need any support
and you think that you can contribute toward the ongoing development
of the software, then this is the version for you.

2. *What is the difference between QVD Community Edition and QVD
Commercial Edition?*
While we release the core QVD software for free to the open-source
community, we understand that businesses are often wary of open-source
projects because they often tend to lack commercial-grade support. The
QVD Commercial Edition includes all of the software released in the
Community Edition but with the added security of a 24/7 support
agreement, additional dedicated resources and access to integration
scripts and thin-client images. We also do our best to promote QVD
Commercial Edition customers, because they are ultimately the people
who are helping to fund the ongoing development of the software.

3. *Do you give license discounts to non-profit, educational and
governmental organizations?*
Sure. If you talk to us, we will try to cater as best as possible to
fit your needs. We are still working through some internal processes
to formalize how we handle license discounting, but we would be more
than happy to work with you to come to some kind of arrangement in the
meantime.

Company
~~~~~~~

1. *Who are the core developers of QVD?*
The core developers of QVD are employees working for the Qindel Group.
We are spread across many countries. with a large team working
directly from Spain, and a smaller team based in Mexico. We also have
members of the team based in Colombia and in the United Kingdom.

2. *What is Qindel Group?*
The Qindel Group is a consultancy company working out of Madrid in
Spain. Qindel has worked for a large number of big enterprise clients
in the banking, telecommunications and governmental sectors. Qindel
tends to focus on projects that promote the use of open-source
technologies and often works to provide better integration with
existing infrastructure. QVD emerged out of a project that Qindel was
originally working on and has released the source-code for. Qindel
continues to actively fund development and dedicates some of its
development resources to the project.

3. *How can I get a full-time job working on QVD?*
QVD is still fairly small, but we're growing fast. We're on the
lookout for more talent that can really help shape our product and
help build its commercial value. If you would like to work with us
full-time, start out by joining the community and contributing there.
If we notice that you're a very active contributor, we will probably
contact you to offer you a full-time position working on the project.
We believe that the best people for hire will be experts on the
technology already. We're giving you all the tools to become an
expert. If you show us what you've got, we'll take you on!
