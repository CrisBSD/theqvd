All of QVD OSE's source code is available to the general public, and
is stored in a Subversion repository. We make our code available for
non-contributors via the web using Trac. You can review the code here: 

link:http://theqvd.com/trac/browser[Browse the QVD Source Code].

If you're serious about contributing to our project, you will need to
sign our link:/community/how-to-contribute/qvd-contributor-agreement[Contributors
Agreement] and we will provide you with the details required to access our Subversion
repository directly.

QVD Technology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QVD makes use of a wide range of technologies available under Linux in
order to provide a single coherent product. In order to do this, QVD
makes heavy use of the link:http://www.perl.org/[Perl] programming
language to tie different technologies together and to provide an
integration framework. Perl is also used heavily in our Layer-7
routing technology that acts as the connection broker and
load-balancer within any solution. Our use of Perl not only makes much 
of the source code accessible to a wide audience of potential developers, 
but also provides the flexibility to port the product to other platforms.

At the core of any QVD deployment, we rely on a
link:http://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL database] to
store all configuration and event information. Different components
communicate with the database in order to trigger new events or to
check the status of other components. PostgreSQL is an open-source
relational database management system with a wide user base. Any
requirement to change the source-code here can be fed back to the
PostgreSQL community.

QVD relies on link:http://www.linux-kvm.org/[KVM] and
link:http://lxc.sourceforge.net/[LXC] in order to provide different
virtualization environments within which the virtual desktop facility
actually runs. Both of these technologies are fully open source and
are under active development. QVD makes use of these technologies to
run virtualized environments on each server node. The server nodes are
actively managed using QVD composed Perl code to integrate the
virtualization software with the rest of the solution.

Inside each disk image that gets loaded into a virtualization
environment, the QVD Virtual Machine Agent ensures that client
applications can connect to an X-Session using the NX protocol. The
core libraries for the NX protocol are provided as open-source
software under the GNU Public License by
link:http://www.nomachine.com/[NoMachine].

The QVD Web Administration Tool is built using the
link:http://www.catalystframework.org/[Perl Catalyst]
framework, making it simple to port other Perl administrative
functions within the QVD Solution into the Web Administration Tool.
Catalyst is an open-source framework available via the
link:http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst-Runtime/[Perl CPAN].

With a general awareness of the technologies involved, you can
contribute to QVD by either working directly on our own source code or
by helping to contribute to any one of the technologies that we make
use of.
