Developers Developers Developers!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The QVD project can always benefit from developer input. If you know a
bit about Linux, Perl, Catalyst or PostgreSQL, you are already in a
position to contribute. We take developers
very seriously and keep an eye on contributions and patches. We want
to grow the QVD team, so finding developers who write good
code and are fired up about working in an open-source community is the
best place for us to look for new talent.

If you want to get started, take a look at the source code and see
whether you have anything to offer. If you think that you could
improve on things, you can sign our
link:/community/how-to-contribute/qvd-contributor-agreement[Contributors
Agreement] and send us
a scanned copy and we will provide you with access to our SVN
repository, along with other information that you may find helpful to
get you started.

Testers
~~~~~~~
Good code is as much in the writing as in the testing. The quicker we
can find and iron out bugs, the better for everyone. You can help us by
testing the product, reporting bugs, sending patches and requesting
enhancements. We're busy formalizing our testing procedure, so that we
can send dedicated testers a script that they can follow to work
through each of the major parts of the product. If you have experience
in formal test procedures, or have a background in dedicated testing,
you could really help us out. By getting fully engaged in the testing
process, you get access to new features before they are released and
will get mention in the credits for the product.

If you're happy to work on the released product and just report back
to us, we'd very much appreciate your help. If you want to get
involved in the more formal testing and have access to beta packages
before they are released, then you will need to sign our
link:/community/how-to-contribute/qvd-contributor-agreement[Contributors
Agreement] and send us a scanned copy. Once we have you on file, we
will give you access to all of the information that you need to get
started.

Packaging
~~~~~~~~~
If you're into packaging, you might be able to help us port QVD to your 
preferred distribution. Making sure that all dependencies are met,
that the software is installed into the correct places and functions
properly for a particular distribution is a challenge. We've nailed it
for Ubuntu and SuSE, but if QVD is really going to grow, we want to
see it running on all flavours of Linux.

If you can port our software to another distribution, let us know
about it and we will help to support your efforts in maintaining the
port.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Documentation is essential. Too many open-source projects remain
undocumented or allow documentation to go out of date. While we have a
dedicated technical author working flat out to keep documents up to
date, often things get missed or screenshots fall out of date.

We document everything using Asciidoc so all you need is a simple text
editor and some screenshot capturing software. By joining us to work
on documentation, you will have access to our SVN repository so that
you can access existing document sources to update them. Sign our
Contributors Agreement and you can get started right away!

Documentation is not just limited to manuals and guides. We want to
get proactive with screencasts and other video content. If you have
experience with this, perhaps you can help here too. Send us links to
uploaded video content and we will link to them directly from our
site, or host the content for you if necessary.

Benefits
~~~~~~~~
Contributors to QVD should not remain behind the curtain. We want to
give you the recognition that you deserve. Once you have joined up
with us and actively started contributing, you will appear in the 
credits for the software and we will be happy to provide references
for you.

As QVD grows, more opportunities will open up in the core QVD team,
and the best way to get a place working full time on the project is to
already be contributing to it. We'll look out for top contributors and
contact them if there is a position available within the team.
