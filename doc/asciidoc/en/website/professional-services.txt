Professional Services
=====================

Setting up a VDI and migrating your users onto a new platform can be a
daunting task. Sure, setting up a demo environment to check out QVD's
capabilities is easy enough, and for many SME users providing a basic
solution to service a dozen end-users can be achieved with little
assistance. However, for many larger businesses the challenges imposed
in terms of assessing requirements and selecting hardware, migrating
users, integrating with existing software and infrastructure, and
finally providing training can turn a simple VDI deployment into a
complex and resource-hungry project.

That's why we don't expect you to do everything on your own. The QVD
can provide dedicated Professional Services through the Qindel Group.
Since the majority of the core development team, systems and software
architects and QVD engineers are employed directly by the Qindel
Group, you can be certain that any assistance you require to go-live
with a QVD deployment will involve the best minds in the business.

The Qindel Group can provide your organization with dedicated
resources to assist in:

* Requirements analysis
* Architecture and design
* Installation and configuration
* Operating system image customization
* Solution behavior customization
* Software integration
* Development
* Training

Pricing for professional services are generally structured around
customer requirements and project size. If you're interested in
