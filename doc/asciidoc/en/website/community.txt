QVD is an open-source project. We welcome all of our users to join the
QVD Community, and invite you to share contributions of bug-fixes,
enhancements, or other modifications with other users and with the
core QVD team so that they can make their way into future releases of
the software.

If you’re a developer and want to get your hands dirty, why not
link:http://theqvd.com/community/source-code[download the source code] 
and take a look at what we’ve built so far.
We keep all of our code in a subversion repository to manage our
change control. If you think that you have something worth
contributing, let us know and we will work out a way to incorporate
your code.

Our end-users are important to us as well. Contributions of feature
requests and bug reports are just as useful as the code itself. By
submitting a link:http://theqvd.com/community/report-a-bug[bug report or a feature request], you are helping to
improve the product for yourself and for other users.

Help with documentation is also widely appreciated. We mostly write
our documentation using link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc], because its simple and portable and
it can be stored within our subversion repository for change control.
Documentation isn’t just about writing. Often we struggle to keep
screenshots up to date, so even if you don’t think you can write, you
can certainly help to keep the images within our manuals in good
shape. If you think you can help with documentation let us know and we
will help you get started.

Finally, too many good open-source software simply disappears because
people don’t know about it. We’re looking for people who can help to
make some noise and get a good project noticed. If you blog about us,
or write about us, or just tell your friends, you’re helping. We’ll
try to give you some recognition for your efforts towards making this
project grow, so let us know what you’ve been doing.

If you don’t know where to start, join the Trac and start posting in
link:http://theqvd.com/trac/discussion[our forum] to get to know other people who are passionate about QVD!
