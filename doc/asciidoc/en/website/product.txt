Desktop virtualization is becoming increasingly common-place. In a
market that is dominated by some of the bigger players such as VMWare,
Citrix and Oracle; QVD offers a Linux focused, low-cost alternative
that provides users with a high-density commercial-grade virtual
desktop infrastructure with link:/product/features[features] that 
you would expect to pay good money for.

QVD provides a simple approach to managing Linux desktop environments
on an enterprise scale, reducing hardware and licensing costs while
easing manageability and administration. In this model, desktop images
are created for different groups of users and are loaded into separate
virtual machines running on one or more QVD Server Nodes. Workstations
are able to connect to any Server Node using the QVD GUI Client
software in order to access the user’s desktop.

QVD provides a safe and secure environment, which even facilitates
remote user access over low-bandwidth connections, allowing
home-workers and road-warriors to access their desktop environment
easily from anywhere in the world, without any requirement for a VPN.
Since QVD provides client software for Linux and Windows, users can
make use of any PC to gain access to their virtual desktops. We’ve
even got a client for Android in development, so whatever your
workstation platform, you will always be able to get to your desktop,
files and applications.

QVD is an open-source project. That means that, unlike with other
commercial vendors, you have complete control over your virtualization
environment and can adapt it to your own particular requirements. That
doesn’t mean you’re on your own. QVD is also a commercial enterprise
and customers are rewarded with next business day support 24×7, along
with a host of other facilities and features. QVD gives you the
flexibility and freedom of open-source software, with the support and
development cycle of any other commercial vendor.

You can link:/product/download[download and install QVD for free], 
and take advantage of the QVD Community Edition to try it out for yourself.
Alternatively, gain access to additional resources including our
professional services, quality support and access to complimentary
software and addon features by purchasing a license for

managing your own infrastructure, and just want your users to have instant desktop 
access from anywhere in the world, then take a look at the
