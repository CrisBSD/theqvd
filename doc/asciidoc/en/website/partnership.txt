If you're into systems integration, desktop deployment or software
reselling, you might be interested in developing a mutually beneficial partnership
with us. We can offer partners a number of great incentives to join up
and work directly with us.

Discounted Licensing and Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The QVD provides partners with discounted licensing, so that a partner
is able to obtain some of the revenue that would be available through
the software licensing model. 

Partners are also able to take advantage of discounted support, so
that each partner is able to obtain a percentage of the revenue
generated through the annual support agreement.

QVD recognizes that different partners are able to service different
sorts of customers. In this way, discounting is calculated based on
the annual sales forecast in terms of the number of licenses sold.
Discounts for partners that are working with large-scale deployments
are generally higher than smaller deployments. 

Dedicated Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our partnership agreements include the designation of dedicated
support personell on both sides of the agreement. In this way, we can
guarantee that the communications chain is properly managed and can
offer end-customers reassurance that their problems will be resolved
in a timely manner.

For CIRs, the QVD will provide technical training in the product to
ensure that the partner is properly versed in the technology and
fully understands how to support it. CIRs are also required to commit
to a Service Level Agreement that is specified in the Partnership
Contract.

Training
~~~~~~~~
We want our partners to be completely knowledgeable about the product
they will be selling, so we insist on providing the appropriate
training to bring our partners up to a level where we can be confident
that they will offer customers the best possible service and where
they can feel fully equipped to handle customer queries.

In order to achieve qualified partnership status with the QVD, any
partner will have undergone a rigorous training course in the core
technology. Both CRs and CIRs are given sales training that helps them
to understand use cases along with the strengths of the QVD product.
CIRs are also given detailed technical training in order to establish
the technical expertise required to provide first-tier support for the
product, and so that deployment and professional service engagements
can run as smoothly as possible.
