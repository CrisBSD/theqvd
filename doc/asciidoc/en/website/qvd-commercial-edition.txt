QVD Commercial Edition offers all of the benefits of QVD Community
Edition, but with the dedicated support of the QVD Support Team, 
and access to features and services that will help you to better 
integrate with existing infrastructure.

What you get
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're paying good money for QVD, you will want to know what you're
getting. Before we get into the details, consider that by choosing QVD
to virtualize your desktop environment you will already be making
significant savings in terms of hardware, maintenance and security
auditing. Your contribution towards paying licensing for your users
will provide you with commercial grade support and the security of
knowing that this product will continue to be under active development
in the future. Furthermore, you will be helping to fund an open-source
initiative that will benefit not only yourself, but other users of the
software as well.

QVD Priority Support Contract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While QVD accepts bug submissions and feature requests from users of
the Community Edition, our paying customers must always come first.
By opting to use QVD Commercial Edition, your requirements and
problems automatically jump to the front of the queue. Our developers
and technical support engineers will always handle any issues that you
are experiencing with top priority.

In fact, QVD offers a Next-Business-Day support model, so that you can
be assured that within 24-hours of contacting the support team, you
will have one or more engineers dedicated to working on your request.

Furthermore, as a QVD Commercial Edition customer, you will have
access to our internal Knowledge-base, which includes a variety of
integration scripts and help resolving a wide variety of frequently
encountered technical problems.

QVD ThinClient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Although QVD provides its GUI Client software as part of the
Community Edition, serious users of any VDI software often want
their user-base to experience a more seamless relationship with their
virtual desktops. This means hiding the underlying client operating
system from the user, so that the user cannot take advantage of it to
install and run unauthorized applications, or simply avoid using the
virtual desktop entirely.

QVD provides a ThinClient operating system for QVD Commercial Edition
customers. The QVD ThinClient operating system is a cut-down version
of Linux that presents the end-user with the QVD Client Login as soon
as the ThinClient has booted. As a result, the user can only login to
his or her virtual desktop, and is unaware of the underlying operating
system.

This provides you with an image that can quickly and easily be installed 
onto your workstation hardware so that workstation substitution is
simple and efficient. It also helps to reduce the number of support
calls that your IT department is likely to receive, and reduces the
amount of troubleshooting that will need to be performed.

QVD Professional Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Serious enterprise users often need help migrating large user-bases
onto a virtualized platform. There are frequently integration
challenges, and ensuring that users are provided with the software
that is needed is a complex exercise. Furthermore, fully understanding
the QVD architecture and its capabilities requires valuable research
time and dedicated staff. If you're deploying QVD in a commercial
environment, you can't afford for things to go desperately wrong.

QVD Commercial Edition users can take advantage of our Professional
Services team, who can assist you with anything from planning your
solution to hard and dirty migration. Why waste time and resource
trying to adopt a new technology when you can have the ultimate
experts on the product help you?

Pre-configured Base System Disk Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you've selected QVD as your choice VDI, you still need to build
your System Disk Images (DIs) that will get served up to your users.
This can be a challenging prospect, especially if you've selected a
distribution that isn't supported out of the box. Furthermore, simply
ensuring that the image is properly configured for your requirements
and behaves in the way that your users expect, may not be in your
immediate field of expertise.

QVD Commercial Edition customers can get help from the QVD Support
Team in building and configuring Disk Images that work
properly. Simply submit your requirements, and we will build the image
for you and make it available for you to download when it is complete.

QVD Remote Support Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If your IT department is staffed a little thinly, you may want to take
advantage of our remote support management option. By configuring VPN
or SSH access to your environment, QVD Support staff can give you
hands-on support for your VDI. This reduces troubleshooting time, and
saves you from tennis-match style email. You tell us the problem, and
we fix it for you.

QVD Prestige
^^^^^^^^^^^^
As a paying customer, we want to let the community know who you are
and who they owe their thanks to. QVD Commercial Edition customers
will get special mention on our website along with a link back to
their own. QVD is constantly exploring ways to offer QVD customers a
little more prestige for their contribution.

Pricing
~~~~~~~
QVD pricing is structured around a 'per-user' licensing model. While
we charge a little more for the first year, since we expect this to be
the period during which you will need your support the most, support
fees per user for subsequent years is greatly reduced, offering you
the assurance that ongoing support costs are not going to be
prohibitively expensive.
