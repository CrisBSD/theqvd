What is QVD?
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quality Virtual Desktop is a powerful, open-source virtual desktop
infrastructure (VDI) that makes it easy to deploy highly scalable and
low-cost solutions to provision any number of users with local and
remote access to their Linux desktop environments.

QVD aims to provide a secure, reliable and easy-to-manage service that
can be installed within any enterprise environment quickly and with
minimal difficulty. It is focussed primarily on delivering Linux-based
virtual desktop environments to end-users with the aim of lowering
licensing costs and encouraging the adoption of open-source technology
within the enterprise.

We believe that as many applications including email, office tools,
banking, and other facilities move into the 'cloud', Linux is becoming
increasingly viable as the standard desktop environment within the
workplace, massively reducing licencing and support costs.

QVD provides the perfect way to manage Linux users within large
organizations, allowing systems administrators to effectively
implement security policies, manage application installation and
provision remote desktop access with ease.

Why the Ladybird?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ladybird (Coccinellidae) was selected as QVD's mascot due to its bright colors,
which serve as a defense against predators who typically associate
bright colors with poison. It is also an effective natural predator of
many crop pests, and as a result is often regarded as a lucky icon by
many cultures around the world.

QVD defines its core values as:

 * Security
 * Protection
 * Performance
 * Effectiveness

We believe that the ladybird represents each of these core values in
some way or another.

We also think that the ladybird icon is simply colorful and friendly
looking. As a project we aspire toward these principals, engaging our
customers, staff and contibutors in a friendly and colorful way.
