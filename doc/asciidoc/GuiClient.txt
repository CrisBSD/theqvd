~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message appears when the server is not responding to the client petition.

    * Ensure all components are running in the server side, HKD, L7R and RC.
    * Check server logs, by default in "/var/log/qvd.log".
    * Check exists network communication client <-> server. Do crossed pings. 

The server has rejected your login. Please verify that your username and password are correct.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This messages occurs when exists communication between client and server but the user can't be authenticated.

    * Verify username and password.
    * Verify user exists in QVD user list:

      QVD-Admin/bin/qvd-admin.pl user list
----
    * If you are using LDAP authentication verify user and password in your LDAP server.
