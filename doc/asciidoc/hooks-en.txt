QVD Hooks
=========
Salvador Fandino
v1.0, Jan 2011

Introduction
------------
Hooks are scritps that the VMA run in the virtual machine at certain situations and that allows to modify the platform behavior with the purpose of adapt it to a concrete problematic.

Each possible hook it's configured by adding an entry to the configuration file "/etc/qvd/vma.conf" with the script path to be executed. 

For example, adding this line

....
  vma.on_action.connect = /etc/qvd/hooks/connect.sh
....

It makes that the script "/etc/qvd/hooks/connect.sh" will be executed everytime that the user connects to the virtual machine.

Scripts can receive by the command line paramentes related to the following entities:

  - State changes, acction, or the provisioning process that has triggered the call to the hook. 

  - Virtual machine properties defined in the administration database

  - Parameters generated by the authentication plugins. 

  - User connection parameters.

  - Parameters supply by the client program. 

Hooks have their own log file, that by default is /var/logs/qvd/qvd-hooks.log in the virtual machine. 

Action hooks
------------

Action hooks are executed everytime that an action begins.

If hook fails with an non zero error code action will be aborted. 

All action hooks receive this paramenters. 

  - "qvd.vm.session.state": Current X-Windows server state

  - "qvd.hook.on_action": Action that triggers the hook.


connect
~~~~~~~

key: *vma.on_action.connect*

This hook is executed when user start (or resume) an X-Windows session from the QVD's client. 

It also receives the following parameters 

  - "qvd.vm.user.name" : user's login. 

  - "qvd.vm.user.groups" : groups that the user belong. 

  - "qvd.vm.user.home" : User's directory home. 

More connection parameters and those assigned in the database to the VM and those generated by the authentication plugin.  

pre-connect
~~~~~~~~~~~

key: *vma.on_action.pre-connect*

This hook is executed when user start (or resume) an X-Windows session from t
he QVD's client.

The difference respect to the connect hooks is that pre-connect hooks are executed before the provisioning hooks, while connect hooks are executed after the provisioning hooks. 

Parameterers for pre-connect are the sames that for connect. 


stop
~~~~

key: *vma.on_action.stop*

This hook is executed when a X-Windows session is asked to be closed (for example via administration tool).

There is no additional paramentes for this hook.

suspend
~~~~~~~

key: *vma.on_action.suspend*

This hook is executed when an X-Windows session is suspended (for expample if an user has closed the QVD Client program)

There is no additional paramentes for this hook.

poweroff
~~~~~~~~

key: *vma.on_action.poweroff*

This hook is executed when the virtual machine is shuted down. 

There is no additional paramentes for this hook.


State hooks
-----------

State hooks are executed when happens a change in the X-Windows session

They'll receive the parameter "qvd.hook.on_state" with the current X-Windows state. 

connected
~~~~~~~~~

key: *vma.on_state.connected*

This hook is executed once a connection has been succefusly established between the QVD client and the X-Windows server that runs in the virtual machine. 

suspended
~~~~~~~~~

key: *vma.on_state.suspended*

This hook executes once the user closes the QVD client and the X-Windows session is in the suspended state

stopped
~~~~~~~

key: *vma.on_state.disconnected*

This hook executes when the X-Windows session ends.


Provisioning hooks
------------------

The provisioning hooks recieve the same parameters that the 'connect' actin hook.


mount_home
~~~~~~~~~~

key: *vma.on_provisioning.mount_home*

By default, QVD mounts the first partition of the device configured with the entry "vma.user.home.drive" on the directory "/home" where the user's directory home is created (by the hook 'add_user'). In case that this partition does not exist is created on the fly.

With this hook it is possible to change this proccess by example mount "/home" from an NFS server


add_user
~~~~~~~~

key: *vma.on_provisioning.add_user*

When a user is connected for first time, if the user still does nor exists a new account is created for him in the virtual machine.

By default the account is created with the useradd "command"

The hook 'add_user' allows to modify this proccess and create the user account in other ways


after_add_user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

key: *vma.on_provisioning.after_add_user*

Once the user account has been created, this hoon can be used to make some additonals actions as by example to configure the user's email client or any other actions. 


Printing hooks
--------------

Also exist a set of hooks that allow to manage the printers configuration, but at the moment theses are considered privates, and a responsability of QVD's development team and therefore they can't be modified by the platform administrator.

Printing hooks receive as parameter the configuration from the VMA.

connected
~~~~~~~~~

key: *internal.vma.on_printing.connected*

This hook receive the same parameters that tha 'connect' action hook

suspended
~~~~~~~~~

key: *internal.vma.on_printing.suspended*

stopped
~~~~~~~

key: *internal.vma.on_printing.stopped*
