Monitoring, Stats and Support Capabilities
==========================================

Keeping track of what your users are doing, how their systems are running and what is going on inside your network can be a formidable task. By virtualizing your users' desktops you can simplify system monitoring and ease desktop support. QVD includes all of the tools that your IT staff need to be able to properly manage and support your VDI.

Web Admin Tool and Command Line Utility
---------------------------------------
QVD comes with a powerful Web-based Administration Tool, that allows your support staff to monitor which users are logged into which virtual machines. The Web Admin Tool provides statistical information and includes tools that can be used to control access to different virtual machines and disk images as required, giving your support staff full control over the infrastructure in a simple and intuitive way. The Web Admin Tool even includes a java applet that provides console access to each running virtual machine, so that a support engineer is able to directly access a virtual machine while it is running.

For more advanced administrators, a feature rich command-line utility is also available. This can be used to script and automate tasks that need to be performed regularly. This tool also allows administrators to perform more complex tasks than are available within the Web Administration Tool. Since statistical information can be extracted from this tool, your administrators can easily build notification or graphical tools that can be triggered for particular scenarios.

Console Access, SSH and VNC
---------------------------
Every virtual machine, run for every user, provides its own console access... and is also capable of supporting SSH and VNC... so that your support staff are able to access the virtual machine while it is being used. By enabling VNC on any remote desktop, it is possible to share the user's desktop to help to view and resolve issues that a user may be experiencing directly with an application or with the desktop environment itself. SSH access makes it possible for administrators or support staff to access a virtual machine securely and directly from any system that has the industry standard tool installed. This means that it is technically possible for a support engineer to help users even when out of the office. 

Logging
-------
QVD stores the logs for each virtual machine separately to the disk image that has been used to run the virtual machine itself. This makes it possible to easily look at log data retroactively to solve problems with individual virtual machines. Since each virtual machine will usually be running one or other Linux distribution, it is also possible to set up a single syslog server, where logging for all of the virtual machines can be easily captured and can be monitored.

QVD also includes its own logging capabilities so that it is possible to turn up log verbosity in order to troubleshoot any problems within the QVD infrastructure itself. QVD is capable of publishing using a variety of log formats, and can output to most typical log management facilities, including most databases, syslog or to file.

Programmability
---------------
QVD is also highly programmable. It includes a full API and provides 'hooks' that can be used to trigger script events from within any virtual machine. This programmability makes QVD incredibly versatile. If you need to trigger provisioning scripts based on successful logins, or if you need to control access to resources depending on location or time, QVD provides all of the facilities that you need in order to control how your VDI behaves.

QVD's support and administration tools are incredibly powerful, and the ability to script and program around the environment can allow you to achieve things that are simply not possible within a traditional desktop workstation environment.
