=head1 TITLE

qvd-vm-killer - The QVD orphaned VM killer.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Kill any QVD VM that keeps still running after the controlling HKD
daemon has terminated.

This program is intended to be run for cron every minute. If the HKD
is running it will exit immediately. Otherwise it will look for VMs
that may still be running (both KVM and LXC bassed) and kill all its
processes.

Under normal operation, the HKD will stop any container and its
processes before exiting. If for whatever reason that doesn't happen
(for instance, due to some software bug or the HKD process being
killed) any orphaned VM must be killed in order to avoid any
possibility of having it running simultaneously in two QVD nodes.
