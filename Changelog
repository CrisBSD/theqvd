QVD-3.6.0
=========
	- Allow setting the number of CPUs per VM when using the KVM
	  backend.
	- Update vm_state_ts every time vm_state changes in the database
	  table vm_runtimes.
	- Allow setting per container cgroups limits for CPU sets and
	  memory. The memory limit comes from the OSF, the cpuset size from
	  the global configuration setting "vm.lxc.cpuset.size"
	- Improve the cgroups file system layout autodetection. Now,
	  setting "path.cgroup" is preferred over setting
	  "path.cgroup.cpu.lxc" and the HKD would look for the cpuset, cpu
	  and memory cgroups below.
	- Set the right permissions for the files containing the SSL
	  certificates.
	- On the VMA, open log files in autoflush mode so that no logging
	  lines are lost.
	- Do not require having a CLR file in L7R.
	- Allow one to set the database listening port.
	- Add support for recent versions of overlayfs requiring a
	  different set of parameters at mount time
	- Add Nothing backend for performance testing.
	- Several fixes ensuring a correct TLS usage.
	- Allow one to pass custom options to sshfs from the VMA.
	- Add support for USB/IP.
	- Check kernel module br_netfilter is loaded at HKD start time.
	- Log failures of external commands on the VMA.
	- Improve login normalization on LDAP authentication backend.
	- Show running DI in qvd-admin vm listing.
	- Allow one to add a K, M or G postfix to the memory size when
	  creating a new OSF with "qvd-admin osf add"
